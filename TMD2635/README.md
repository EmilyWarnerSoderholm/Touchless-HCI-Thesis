# Arduino Library for the ams TMD2635 proximity sensor

### Summary

WORK IN PROGRESS (it functions but is not appropriate for gesture recognition):
currently, the code reads sensor data from 0x38 and 0x39, where they each give slightly different output to the same input. output is believed to be in mV and has been mapped linearly to 0-100mm, however this does not function well.
